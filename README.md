### Me

I've been told to create one of these because my [personal site](http://codeofrob.com) is a bag of bones (It was geocitified as a joke and it was never changed back).

I'm Rob, and I work for [id3as](https://github.com/robashton/) full time, building distributed media/content-delivery systems using

- Erlang
- Purescript
- Rust

This has been the case for about ten years now, before then

- I was a "journeyman" (snark), wandering around the globe doing discrete/focused jobs for companies and learning how everybody else liked to do things.
- I was a consultant working as a "technical expert" for a huge international company in Belgium building data analytics tools in Silverlight (lol)
- I was a .NET developer working as a technical lead for an SME near Oxford

I have been known to talk at conferences, although I do less of that these days. My popular talks were about Javascript and .NET and I don't do those things any more and nobody wants to hear about functional programming because heaven forbid people be shown something outside of their comfort zone at these things.

I don't have any actual open source on Github, my popular repos are either joke projects like [erlang.net](https://github.com/robashton/erlang.net), learning projects like [cravendb](https://github.com/robashton/cravendb) or games that written in JS that probably don't build any more like [hoverbattles](https://github.com/robashton/hoverbattles)

I use Github for work, so most of my commits are work related. My spare time is spend doing things that isn't work, so doesn't (these days) end up producing things for this site. I'm okay with that.
